# OneMonth Learning Notes

Welcome to my `1month-learning` repository! This repository serves as my personal codebook, tracking my journey of leveling various programming-related skills. It is a compilation of mainly two things:
- **Learning log:** as showcased in the respective `README` file in each course folder. Which in essence are my notes and thoughts on things I have learned from the course or by myself as extra.
- **Projects:** a compilation of all the projects I have codes as a result of the course or self-initiation, following a learning through practice motto.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into separate folders for each course. Within these course folders, each has its own `README` file, where the **learning log**/summary is written, there is also a `projects` folder where all the **projects** are saved.

Here is a basic view of the repository's structure:

```
1month-learning
│   README.md (*what you are reading*)
│
└─── Course folder (*e.g. beginner-ruby*)
│   │   README.md (**Learning Log**)
│   │
│   └─── Projects folder
│   │   ...

```

## Contributing 

While these notes are primarily for my own reference, others who are learning to code might find them useful. If you're one of these people and you'd like to contribute to these notes or suggest improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
