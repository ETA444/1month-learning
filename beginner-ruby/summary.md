# Chapter 1: Setting up

First we install Ruby, which is done on Windows with the [Ruby Installer](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/).  The teacher recommends [GitBash](https://git-scm.com/download/win), which I recommend using through Windows PowerShell to avoid many errors.
## Command Line Crash Course
Next, we learned some very basic commands such as:
```shell
pwd # print working directory
ls # list directories here
ls -a # list also hidden
start #or
explorer # in gitbash is how you open 
cd Desktop # change directory to desktop folder
cd ~ # change directory to home directory
```

Next we were introduced to the Interactive Ruby environment (IRB), which is how we can write Ruby inside the terminal.

```shell
irb
1+1
name = "Your Name"
```

Some basic commands and we move on to the next chapter.
